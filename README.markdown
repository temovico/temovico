A lightweight PHP MVC framework. This is a refactored version of code initially developed at [Technorati](http://technorati.com) by [Matthew Levine](http://matthewlevine.com/), [Andrei Scheinkman](http://andreischeinkman.com/) and [Ryan King](http://theryanking.com/) with later development by [Stephen Handley](http://github.com/stephenhandley) and [Courtland Alves](http://courtlandalves.com/), who is currently leading the project.

Please see an [example implementation](http://github.com/temovico/temovico_example).
